1. Steps_tracker and Water_Intake_Tracker have designs
2. They are quite minimalistic(or boring) and have one color scheme. Steps is green, Water is blue
3. Added some drawables for the their respective layouts
4. Added a log water intake button in Water_tracker page but it connects to none. We should leave it at that for now
5. Mostly used Constraint Layout
